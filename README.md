  After reaching the top of the screen successfully the level will increase, the player will be moved to the bottom, and the speed of the cars (blocks) will increase.

  The player in this game is only allowed to move forward so they must think about each time that they decide to move forward.
  Upon dying (getting hit by a block) the player game displays game over text along with what level they ended on.
